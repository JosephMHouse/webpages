        <p>Hey there! My name is Joseph House and I'm an undergraduate student at NC State University.
        I am currently in my freshman year and still adjusting to life away from home, but am enjoying my time so far.
        My intended major is computer science with a concentration in game design.
        I chose this major because I have always had a passion for using computers and for video games, so combining my
        two loves seemed like the logical choice.
        </p>    
        <br />
        <p>My dream job would be to get hired by a game development company after leaving college. I would love to work
        for a large, established company like Epic Games, or a newer start-up company.
        I would mainly be interested in the prospect of working on some sort of roleplaying or strategy game, so being
        hired by a game studio like Paradox Interactive in Sweden would also be a dream come true.</p>
